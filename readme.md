# Trusty

Trusty aims to make basic deformation analyses of trusses subject to loads as convenient as possible. It even supports plotting via [Plots](https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/) and units via [Unitful](https://painterqubits.github.io/Unitful.jl/stable/)!


Working with a truss is as easy as defining it:

```julia
🌈 =
    Truss(1:2 .=> Section(29000000psi, 6inch^2) .=> 2:3, # members
        [0 1 2
        0 1 0]ft, # vertices
        ([1, 3], [1, 3])) # constraints
```

Deforming it:

```julia
🍭 = deform(🌈, Dict(2 => [30000000; 0]lbf))
```

And plotting it all:

```julia
let 🍓 = plottruss(ustrip(ft, 🌈))
    plottruss!(🍓, ustrip(ft, 🍭))
end
```
